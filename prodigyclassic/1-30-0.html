Prodigy Reborn has been dead for months. If you still want to play the absolutely broken one, go to OUTDATED1-30-0.html, but for now...
<h1>Prodigy Reborn, as you knew it, is Dead.</h1>
Please stop harrasing Mashup Week for Jared's Escape being the anticheat. they're sick of it.
Please don't beg us to add huge features or host cloned assets on GitHub.
Please don't ask us to continue support for windows era prodigygame versions, lost to time by smarteacher taking them down.
